		<p> I am a nerd who thinks he is cool, says my wife. I love to cycle long distances on my bike with bike clubs or a small group of friends, despite, having been hit by a car and having to learn how to walk again. My proudest moment was completing the MS 150 tour for cure. This was a two-day bike ride that was broken up into 75 miles per day. During the last 25 miles I felt like I had an out-of-body experience, since I was so tired and fatigued that I could not feel my body anymore and made me feel as though was I was not physically there. As I said in the beginning of class, I am from New Orleans, Louisiana and enjoy cooking all types of Cajun foods such as gumbo, red beans & rice, and shrimp etouffee. The city of New Orleans has definitely played a part in who I am today, and I am blessed to have had that experience.</p>
